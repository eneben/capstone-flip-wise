With a simple form, you can create custom collections of flashcards for any topic you wish to master. Just type in a question and answer, optionally upload an image for added explanation, and save it to an existing collection or start a new one.
Alternatively, use AI to generate flashcards for you. Input your text, choose how many flashcards you want, and let AI create key questions and answers. Review the cards, uncheck any you don‚Äôt want, and save the rest to your collection.

## üìö Learning Mode

In Learning Mode you can scroll through the flashcards of your collection, answer the questions and flip them to check whether you were right or wrong. Mark them as correct or incorrect and click on the bottom menu to see all flashcards of your collection or only correctly or incorrectly answered ones.

## üèãÔ∏è Training Mode

Training Mode shows your flashcard collection as a stack where you only see the top card. You can swipe flashcards left or right to level up or down based on how well you know each one. The cards in the stack are sorted by level ‚Äì from low on top to high leveled cards in the back ‚Äì and by the time when they appeared last.

## üéÆ Gaming Mode

Make learning more fun by playing a game of Memory: Reinforce learning by turning flashcards into a memory game. In this mode, you‚Äôll be presented with a grid of cards, each containing either a question or an answer on their back. Your goal is to find the matching pairs by flipping the cards one at a time.

#### Have fun and enjoy BRAIN STACK!
